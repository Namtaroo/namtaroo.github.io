              with specific themes with the associated brand tied to them. Players can explore U-Coinville
              in which they can participate in events and minigames scattered around the spaces to earn rewards

              I served as the main engineer in the development of this demo. We used third party plugins so that we didn't have to
              reinvent most of the base features of an RPG and to speed up development. My main efforts on this one were focused
              on creating a fluid combat and movement with robust animation blending. I was also tasked with creating an enemy
              AI with responsive behaviors that were based on the players actions. I also act as a VFX artist to make the
              gameplay juicier.

            This was achieved by combining the Procedural Mesh Component provided by Unreal Engine

            I applied the cube sphere method for this implementation in order to accommodate higher
            resolution worlds. By doing this, it will allow us to divide the sphere into chunks
            for selective loading and 'Level of Detail' (LOD) optimizations for realtime rendering.

            A bare-bones character creator which utilizes morph targets embedded in 3D models.
            Our approach for this one was to rig all the base models in Daz3D; we then create morph
            targets to the parts we want to manipulate and add the necessary bones/sockets for attaching equipment
            and accessories. Subsequently, all of those morph targets and other settings are baked into the model to
            be imported into the engine. You can then access these morphs through the skeletal mesh by referencing their names.
